# Shower presentation example

I made a few changes:
- new theme named THM with a new font and other colors. 
- add prettify for code-snippets
- breadcrumbs with the h3-tag (not this nicely done yet)
- add the class: show -> white-space for an picture or in my case an iframe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on [shower](https://github.com/shower/shower) engine and [ribbon](https://github.com/shower/ribbon) theme.

To see Shower in action:

- Open [shwr.me](http://shwr.me/)
- Click any slide to enter presentation mode
- Use arrow keys to navigate
- Press `Esc` to exit presentation mode
