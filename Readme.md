# Shower presentation example

I made a few changes:
- new theme named [THM](https://github.com/cehter/thm) with a new font and other colors. 
- add prettify for code-snippets
- breadcrumbs with the h3-tag (not this nicely done yet)
- add the class: show -> white-space for an picture or in my case an iframe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on [shower](https://github.com/shower/shower) engine.

To see Shower in action:

- Open [shwr.me](http://shwr.me/)
- Click any slide to enter presentation mode
- Use arrow keys to navigate
- Press `Esc` to exit presentation mode

See more details in Shower [readme](https://github.com/shower/shower#readme). Follow [@shower_me](http://twitter.com/shower_me/) for support and updates. Use [Issues](https://github.com/shower/shower/issues) for sharing your ideas, bugs and feature requests.

## Using template

To get Shower template run following command:

``` bash
git clone --recursive git://github.com/shower/template.git
```

Or you can just download [latest version](http://shwr.me/template.zip) as ZIP file.
